# Restaurant-Reccomendation
This project develops a personalized restaurant recommendation system based on user preferences using Yelp Open Database. The system utilizes sentiment analysis and a weighted scoring approach to recommend restaurants tailored to individual user tastes. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model development to quantify restaurant ratings based on user-specific variables. The goal is to provide users with the ability to manually adjust the weightings of different features for more personalized recommendations. The system is built with Python.
